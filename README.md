# microbiome-deep-learning

This is code for the project that I worked on during the summer of 2017 and 2018 along with Dr. Katherine Pollard (UCSF), Dr. Nandita Garud (UCSF), and Dr. Sharon Greenblum (Stanford University). The code has been organized based on the collaborators on the project.
This project utilizes raw DNA data to classify human gut microbiome samples as healthy or diseased. 

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Dr. Nandita Garud (UCSF Gladstone), Dr. Sharon Greenblum (Stanford Medicine), and Professor Katherine Pollard (UCSF Gladstone) for accepting me into their project and for their original ideas, insightful advice, and nurturing mentorship. I would also like to thank Annamarie Bustion (Ph. D candidate in Pollard Lab) and the rest of the Pollard Lab for their work on creating code samples and preprocessing kmer data.
