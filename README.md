# microbiome-deep-learning

This is code for the project that I worked on during the summer of 2017 and 2018 along with Dr. Katherine Pollard (UCSF), Dr. Nandita Garud (UCSF), and Dr. Sharon Greenblum (Stanford University). The code has been organized based on the collaborators on the project.
This project utilizes raw DNA data to classify human gut microbiome samples as healthy or diseased.
